// A map of simple integers to the actual pointers to stream structs. Avoids
// passing pointers into the Go heap to C.
//
// As per the CGo pointers design doc for go 1.6:
//
// A particular unsafe area is C code that wants to hold on to Go func and
// pointer values for future callbacks from C to Go. This works today but is not
// permitted by the invariant. It is hard to detect. One safe approach is: Go
// code that wants to preserve funcs/pointers stores them into a map indexed by
// an int. Go code calls the C code, passing the int, which the C code may store
// freely. When the C code wants to call into Go, it passes the int to a Go
// function that looks in the map and makes the call. An explicit call is
// required to release the value from the map if it is no longer needed, but
// that was already true before.
